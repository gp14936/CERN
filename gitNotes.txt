How you make a repository

To add a new file and commit it ...
git add <filename>;
git commit -m "Your message"


//----------------------------
git diff tells you the differences between the old file and the new file

//---------------------

Need to always do a git add before commit
//-------------------
git checkout
This will checkout the code into your workspace
